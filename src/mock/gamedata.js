    content1: `We set out to build the Otherside with one thing in mind: the
            metaverse should be anything but boring. The world should be
            dynamic, steeped in narrative, and your actions should hold
            consequence. Step into the Otherside, where the normal rules do not
            apply. Where you end up is up to chance. Where you go is up to you.
            The Otherside is part galaxy and part archipelago, with islands
            extending from the Biogenic Swamp at the center and roiling outwards
            to the Infinite Expanse. There are five sediments that lands are
            built upon: Biogenic Swamp, Chemical Goo, Rainbow Atmos, Cosmic
            Dream, and Infinite Expanse. Your Otherdeed is the key to a unique
            blend of environment, sediment, and treasures — some with resources,
            some home to powerful artifacts. And on a very few, a Koda roams.`,

            tread cautiously. Koda 1 Koda 2 Every piece of land in the Otherside
            nurtures up to four replenishing resources that you will be able to
            harvest and utilize. Anima, Ore, Shard, and Root. Some are rare,

    content1: `The Sandbox team is building a unique virtual world where players can build, own, and monetize
        their gaming experiences using SAND, the main utility token of the platform.
        SAND holders will be also able to participate in governance of the platform via a Decentralized
        Autonomous Organization (DAO), where they can exercise voting rights on key decisions of The
        Sandbox ecosystem. As a player, you can create digital assets (Non-Fungible Tokens, aka NFTs),
        upload them to the marketplace, and drag-and-drop them to create game experiences with The
        Sandbox Game Maker. The Sandbox has secured over 50 partnerships including Atari, Crypto Kitties,
        and Shaun the Sheep to build a fun, creative “play-to-earn” Gaming platform, owned and made by
        players.`,
    content2: `The Sandbox gaming ecosystem consists of three integrated products that together provide a
        comprehensive experience for user-generated content (UGC) content production.
        VOXEDIT: This simple to use yet powerful free 3D voxel modelling package allows users to
        create and animate 3D objects such as people, animals, foliage, and tools, and export them
        into The Sandbox marketplace to become game ASSETS.
        MARKETPLACE: The Sandbox’s web-based marketplace allows users to upload, publish, and
        sell their creations (ASSETS) made in VoxEdit, as Tokens (Both ERC-721 and ERC-1155
        tokens).`,
    content3: `The Sandbox virtual world uses blockchain technology and NFTs to empower the players and
        creators. NFTs are an emerging segment in the global game market: virtual tokens for digital scarcity,
        security and authenticity. Each NFT is distinct or unique, it is indivisible and it is not interchangeable
        for another.
        TRUE DIGITAL OWNERSHIP: Gamers are the true and perpetual owners of their digital items,
        even if the game was shut down or abandoned. With blockchain, every game item can be
        tokenized, allowing gamers to decide how they want to trade, sell, or gift their items.
        SECURITY AND IMMUTABILITY: Digital game items can be easily tokenized and traded in
        primary and secondary markets that are managed and facilitated by blockchain technology.
        Items based on scarcity and demand usually invite fraud and theft, but these risks are
        minimised on blockchain because it is a distributed ledger.`,

    content1: `War Riders is currently one of the most anticipated blockchain gaming projects on the horizon. Set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, players will pilot their vehicles throughout the land in search of the only remaining resource, Benzine (BZN). But finding BZN is just the beginning of your journey, because then you have to somehow remain alive and mobile long enough to make it back to your garage in one piece. Once in the safety of their own garages players can then move the captured BZN to their wallets.`,

        with the valuable resource. In order to redeem BZN, the players have to bring what                              
        they’ve collected back to their garages without being shamelessly robbed on the                        
        way home. Benzene will be used to buy better guns, additional garage spaces, armor,                            
        nitro-boost, and it can also be exchanged for other virtual currencies.

        players assemble their very own post-apocalyptic vehicles and prepare for war.
